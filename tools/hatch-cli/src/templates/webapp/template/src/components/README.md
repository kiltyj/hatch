# Components
Components can be generated by running `hatch component <ModuleName>`.

Components are presentational React Components that are concerned with "how things look" and are not directly 
connected to the Redux store. 

If you're adding something that represents a "widget," it is likely a Component. 

In general, prefer Components which are stateless and are simply a pure function of their props.
