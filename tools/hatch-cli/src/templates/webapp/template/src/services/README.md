# Services

Services can be generated by running `hatch injectable <ModuleName>`.

Services are modules which define business logic for the project. These modules often define classes which use the 
`@injectable` decorator, so that their constructor parameters can be injected, and so that they can be injected as
constructor parameters for other classes.

This is a an admittedly pretty generic term for business logic components. The name is meant to parallel Services in
Spring. As a rule of thumb, if a module is not one of the above types, and it is not a generic utility module, then it's
probably a Service.
